\title{Pauly's empirical formula for the estimation of M}
\usage{
M_Pauly(Linf, K, temp, schooling = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Linf}{Infinite length for investigated species in cm [cm].}

\item{K}{Growth coefficient for investigated species per year [1/year].}

\item{schooling}{logical; if TRUE it is accounted for the schooling behaviour of
the species. Default is FALSE.}

\item{Temp}{Average annual temperature at the surface in degrees centigrade.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing M.
}
\description{
Function to calculate the instantaneous natural mortality rate (M)
     according to Pauly's empirical formula.
}
\details{
If accounting for schooling behaviour M is multiplied by 0.8 according to
   Pauly (1983).
}
\examples{
M_Pauly(Linf = 80, K = 0.5, temp = 25)
