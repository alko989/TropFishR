\arguments{
\item{classes}{Midpoints of the length class as vector (length frequency data) or ages as vector (age composition data).}

\item{mean_weight}{Average weight of fish}

\item{FM}{Fishing mortality}

\item{Z}{Total mortality}

\item{value}{Information about the value/price of fish per kilo or gramm}

\item{Tr}{Age of recruitment}

\item{datatype}{Type of data which is used for analysis, either 'length' or 'age', for length frequency or age composition data, respectively}

\item{stock_size_1}{Stock size to start with}

\item{plus.group}{Should a plus group be created, by default (NA) not. BUt authors advise to do so}

\item{FM_change}{Vector containing new FM values}

\item{fleet_mat}{Matrix providing catch or FM values separated by fleets}

\item{fleet_unit}{Either 'Catch' or 'FM' indicating in which unit the fleet_mat is provided}

\item{fleet_FM_change}{Matrix containing new FM values for each fishery}

\item{fleet_plot_name}{Name of fishery, which should be used for plotting Yield per recurit against changes of FM}

\item{FM}{reference F-at-age-array}
}
\description{
This is a function to calculate the total mortality (Z) from length composition data via the length converted catch curve or from age at length data with catch curve.
}
\details{
better to treat last group always as a plus group..... For variable parameter system vectors are reuqired for constant parameter systems matrices or data.frames have to be inserted. or vectors The length converted linearised catch curve is used to calculate the total mortality (Z). This function includes a so called locator function, which asks you to choose points from a graph manually. Based on these points the regression line is calculated.
